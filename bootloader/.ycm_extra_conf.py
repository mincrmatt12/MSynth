"""
YouCompleteMe "ycm_extra_conf.py" for Platformio based projects.
 
The script calls [platformio -v run -t idedata] and process the output 
to fill list with the SAME SET OF FLAGS used by platformio for the 
project (compiler flags, Include dirs, compiler DEFINES, etc)
 
Tested on the following development environment:
    - Linux (LMDE 2)
    - PlatformIO, version 3.3.0a1
    - VIM 8.0
    - YCM 2016-12-22
 
This file should be copied in the "base" project dir (one ycm_extra_conf.py
for every project)
 
Installation:
 Copy this scrit in the project base dir (together with platformio.ini, etc)
 NOTE:
   make sure you've already run "platformio init --board xxx" in the project dir
 
Usage    
    if everything works as expected you just call VIM to edit projet files
 
    To test the script behaviour, run it as a standalone script:
        phython .ycm_extra_conf
    It outputs the FLAGS that will be handle back to YCM
 
    Ideally You don't need to edit this file to add extra flags but,
    in case you need it, add them to the "flags" list at the beginning of 
    this script
